Abstract
This project aims to develop a web-based platform to streamline the application process for the Work-Study Program at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. The current manual process is time-consuming, involves excessive paperwork, and lacks efficiency in communication and updates. The proposed system will automate the application process, enable online submission of forms, and provide real-time updates on application status and placement details. The platform will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MariaDB to ensure scalability, security, and ease of use. By digitizing the process, the system will reduce administrative burdens, improve accessibility, and enhance the overall experience for both students and administrators.

           Chapter One: Introduction
               1.1 Background Information
The Work-Study Program at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology is a vital initiative that provides students with opportunities to work part-time on campus while pursuing their studies. This program not only helps students financially but also equips them with soft skills like being able to take responsibility. However, the current application process is manual, requiring students to print, fill, and submit physical forms. This process is inefficient, time-consuming, and environmentally unsustainable due to the excessive use of paper.

Moreover, students are required to visit notice boards to check their application status and placement details, which often leads to delays and inconvenience. The absence of a centralized system for notifications or updates further exacerbates the problem, causing confusion and frustration among students. In an era where digital transformation is revolutionizing various sectors, it is imperative to adopt modern technologies to streamline administrative processes and improve service delivery.

               1.2 Statement of the Problem
The manual application process for the Work-Study Program is plagued by several challenges:

Time-Consuming Process: Students must physically submit forms and wait for manual processing, which can take days or even weeks. This delay can be particularly problematic for students who rely on the program for financial support.

Excessive Paperwork: The process involves printing and handling physical documents, which is not only cumbersome but also environmentally unfriendly. The reliance on paper-based systems contributes to unnecessary waste and inefficiency.

Lack of Real-Time Updates: Students are required to visit notice boards to check their application status and placement details. This outdated method of communication is inefficient and often leads to missed updates or delays in receiving critical information.

Inefficient Communication: There is no centralized system for notifications or updates, causing delays and confusion. Students often have to make multiple trips to the administration office to inquire about their application status, which is both time-consuming and frustrating.

This project seeks to address these challenges by developing a digital platform that automates the application process, reduces paperwork, and provides real-time updates to students. By leveraging modern web technologies, the proposed system will streamline the entire process, making it more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly.

           Chapter Two: Objectives
               2.1 General Objective
The general objective of this project is to design and develop a digital platform that automates the Work-Study Program application and management process, improving efficiency and user experience for both students and administrators.

               2.2 Specific Objectives
Develop an Online Application System: Create a web-based platform where students can submit their application forms and required documents digitally, eliminating the need for physical paperwork.

Implement Real-Time Notifications: Design a notification system that informs students of their application status and placement details in real-time, reducing the need for manual checks.

Create an Admin Dashboard: Develop a centralized dashboard for administrators to manage applications, approve students, and assign work placements efficiently.

Ensure Data Security and Scalability: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive student data and design the system to handle a large number of users without compromising performance.

Provide a User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and responsive interface that is easy to navigate for both students and administrators, ensuring a seamless user experience.

           Chapter Three: Literature Review
               3.1 Existing Systems
Current work-study management systems in many institutions still rely on manual processes or outdated software, resulting in inefficiencies. While some universities have adopted digital solutions, these are often proprietary and costly, making them inaccessible to many institutions. For instance, some use standalone software that demands extensive training and maintenance, while others rely on generic tools like spreadsheets, which are not tailored for this purpose.

               3.2 Key Technologies
The proposed system will leverage the following technologies:

Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to build an interactive and responsive user interface. These technologies are widely supported and provide the flexibility needed to create a user-friendly design.

Back-End Technologies: PHP will be used for server-side logic, handling tasks such as form processing, user authentication, and database interactions. PHP is a robust and widely-used language that is well-suited for web development.

Database Management: MariaDB will be used to store application data and user information. MariaDB is a reliable and scalable database system that ensures efficient data management and retrieval.

               3.3 Enhancing User Experience
The system will focus on simplicity, speed, and accessibility, ensuring that students and administrators can easily navigate the platform. Real-time updates and notifications will reduce delays and improve communication, while a responsive design will ensure compatibility with various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

               3.4 Comparison with Proposed System
Unlike existing manual systems, the proposed platform will automate the entire process, from application submission to placement notifications, ensuring efficiency and reducing paperwork. The use of modern web technologies will also make the system more scalable and secure, addressing the limitations of current solutions.

           Chapter Four: Methodology
               4.1 Requirements Analysis and Specifications
4.1.1 Functional Requirements
Student Registration and Login: Students should be able to create accounts and log in to the system using their credentials.

Online Application Submission: Students should be able to fill out and submit application forms online, along with scanned copies of required documents.

Real-Time Application Status Updates: Students should receive real-time updates on their application status and placement details.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators should have access to a centralized dashboard for managing applications, approving students, and assigning work placements.

Notification System: The system should send automated notifications to students regarding their application status and placement details.

4.1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
High Availability and Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of users without compromising performance.

Secure Data Storage and Authentication: Sensitive student data should be protected using robust security measures, including encryption and secure authentication protocols.

Fast and Responsive User Interface: The system should provide a seamless user experience, with fast loading times and a responsive design.

               4.2 Conceptual Design
The platform will have two main interfaces:

Student Interface: This interface will allow students to register, log in, submit applications, and view their application status and placement details.

Admin Interface: This interface will provide administrators with tools to manage applications, approve students, and assign work placements.

               4.3 Functional Design
